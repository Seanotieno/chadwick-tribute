            <h2>An Iconic Career of Strength and Grace</h2>
            <p>Chadwick Boseman was more than just an actor; he was a vessel for history and a beacon of hope. He brought immense dignity to his portrayals of real-life American icons like Jackie Robinson in <em>42</em>, James Brown in <em>Get on Up</em>, and Thurgood Marshall in <em>Marshall</em>.</p>
            
            <p>However, he is most globally revered for bringing King T'Challa—the Black Panther—to life. He gave the world its first Black superhero leading a blockbuster film, creating a cultural phenomenon that celebrated African excellence and inspired millions of children to see themselves as heroes.</p>

            <p class="highlight-text">What makes his career truly iconic, and incredibly humbling, is knowing that he filmed many of his most demanding action roles, including <em>Black Panther</em>, <em>Avengers: Infinity War</em>, and <em>Endgame</em>, while secretly battling stage IV colon cancer. His perseverance, work ethic, and commitment to his art in the face of unimaginable adversity define true heroism.</p>
